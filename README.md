# Atmo
### Secure Web Development CA 2

### 1. Instructions
#### 1.1 Description
This application utilises Docker for its application development environment. Server side code is written with the FastAPI framework which runs on Python. The Dockerfile specifies the version of Python to be used in the Docker Container, so you should not need to worry about this or versions of any other server side dependencies, which themselves are versioned in requirements.txt.

#### 1.2 Requirements
In order to build and run the docker container for the application you will need Docker installed and the Docker Engine to be running. The easiest way to do this is to install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). This project also makes use of Docker Compose and it is included with Docker Desktop by default.

Nearly all dependencies are supplied in requirements.txt at the root of file tree. The main exception is for the CSS which uses Tailwind which uses the Tailwind supplied cdn for development. Therefore you will need an active internet connection for the application UI to render as intended.

#### 1.3 Building the Docker Image and Running the Application
Once Docker Desktop is running Docker Engine will also be running in the background as a daemon.  Navigate to the root directory of the project `/Atmo`. One command only should be needed to build the image, install dependencies and run the server for the first time.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

At this point you should be able to navigate to the home page of the application by going to [localhost](http://localhost:8080).

If you wish to stop the application press `ctrl c`. To restart a second time you will not need to rebuild. One Docker Engine is running, simply enter:
```
docker-compose up
```


There a number of accounts already in the database. They have either standard, admin, or owner privileges. See table below for reference. Standard users can only see and manage their own files. Admins and owners can access the Admin area and manage standard users. Only the owner can elevate the privileges of a standard user to admin. Any user who registers is set to standard user by default. **The application currently only accepts sign-up with a ncirl.ie domain.** Passwords can be between 8 to 20 characters inclusive and must have and uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special character. Not all special characters will be accepted.

### 1.4 Dotenv
The `.env` file supplied here would not normally be pushed to GitHub but is here a convenience.


### 2. Application Usage
The option exists to sign in with an existing account using the credentials above or create your own account by clicking 'Sign-up Today!'. An ncirl.ie domain must be used for sign-up it will also accept subdomains such as x123456@student.ncirl.ie. 

Standard users will only be able to see the 'My Files' area of the web application where the audio files are listed. Some sample rows are provided and hard coded into a html table. The only user that has 'files' being pulled from the database is Alice. The ability to upload files has not yet been implemented.

Both admins and owners have access to the admin area and both can delete users from the database. Only the owner can edit a user. The delete 'button' is inline with the list of users presented in the admin area. Clicking on it will immediately delete the user from the database and re-render the page. Clicking on the edit 'button' will land you on a page displaying only that user's details. With the select options menu under 'Role' you can change that userâ€™s permissions. Currently their is a bug changing a user from admin back to a standard user but it should otherwise work.

While the application has not been completed the required functionality to create, read, update and delete exists regarding user accounts. 

Logout is available to all users and will be displayed only when they are logged in. Clicking on it will delete the session cookie and redirect to the home page.
